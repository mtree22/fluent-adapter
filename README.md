**WARNING:** Currently this adapter is under construction. This means that it does not work with recent preCICE versions and we do not recommend using this adapter. If you want to contribute, our issue [Update fluent adapter for compatibility with recent preCICE versions #1](https://github.com/precice/fluent-adapter/issues/1) is a good starting point.

This adapter was originally developed by Bernhard Gatzhammer as a part of his thesis [1]. Richard Hertrich carried out a status update for the adapter in [2].
